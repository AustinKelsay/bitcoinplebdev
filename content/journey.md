# From Bitcoin pleb to bitcoinplebdev (my coding journey from zero)

I was not a “technical” person by any means around 2017 when I was first discovering Bitcoin (and I hardly am today) but as soon as the concept of open digital money clicked with me I knew that I wanted to be involved in this movement somehow. With enthusiasm and naivety I have continued to engage with the Bitcoin world since then and have been humbled and rebuilt continually by interacting with this powerful idea and technology. The most important transformation throughout all of this for me has been going from zero coding experience to becoming a fullstack developer and making my first small moves in the Bitcoin development ecosystem.

I was a 23 year old highschool dropout with two deadend jobs when I discovered Bitcoin.

Just a few months earlier I would have been in the exact wrong place, jaded, depressed, and carrying a chip on my shoulder. But I had drastically changed my mindset. I had decided that I wanted to be open and optimistic about finding some purpose or some kind of future to work towards. This was mostly a fear response though. A lot of my time was spent delivering Jimmy Johns sandwiches in Oklahoma City my lifelong home thus far. I witnessed over time that most of the people I delivered to or even saw around the city were living lives they hated. Addicted apartment dwellers, overworked lawyers, pompous yuppies, and demoralized call center representatives, these were some of the many people I interacted with on a day to day basis. You can imagine how this begins to have an effect on someone’s world view especially after years of working this job. From my point of view it seemed that most don’t make it, and by don’t make it I mean they don’t manage to avoid building their own personal hell and locking themselves in it. These realizations had a profound impact on me and they helped me begin to reframe my life and my current position. I was still young and had ample time to turn things around and find a viable direction for myself. I didn’t know what direction I wanted to head but the stark contrast of the self created prisons I saw all around me gave me a sense of where not to go so I could at least start taking steps. for the first time in a longtime I felt hope.

It was only with this mindset that my ears were open to hear the first mention of Bitcoin while eaves dropping on a conversation at work. Apparently someones brother was making a lot of money mining Bitcoin. I didnt know what that was or what that meant in the moment but my mind was open and seeking so I kept it in the back of my head the rest of my shift and when I got home searched “bitcoin“ on Youtube for the first time. Nothing really clicked with my first exposure but the whole topic peaked my curiosity and I knew I wanted to understand more. I’ll never forget when I first read the term “Proof-of-work”, I spent my whole delivery day pulling up articles about mining and listening to Bitcoin podcasts. This concept totally captured me and quickly had me considering Bitcoin with a new level of seriousness. The idea that work or energy could be globally quantified and verified on a worldwide computer network was fascinating to me.

Needless to say my momentum down the rabbit hole only accelerated from there, I began devouring every bit of information and education I could find about Bitcoin. Exposing myself to these concepts opened doors in my mind that I never knew existed, I was reimagining and reconstructing my place in the world and what kind of future I wanted to build towards. Beyond this I found that engaging with Bitcoin helped me clarify my own values and inclinations like never before. Undoubtedly this deep dive into economics, networks, and computing began crystalizing into a vision and a desire to be able to work with and build on Bitcoin. At this point I had never written a single line of code or even thought about learning. I had no idea how long and how difficult of a journey it would be nor how rewarding and transformational it would become. I thought to myself I might as well try and see what I can do with a few months of learning and practice!

So my coding journey started with a $10 python Udemy course that I went through in between my shifts working as a delivery boy. Initially I was super excited to jump in and (of course) I severely overestimated how quickly I would be able to pick up the basics and gain some actionable knowledge. After just a few weeks stumbling my way through the material I felt I had stopped learning and instead was just copying the contents of the lessons; I couldn't explain or rebuild almost any of what I was following in the course. It was feeling like homework all over again (something I’m very bad at) where I was merely using rote memory to reproduce what was being given to me versus building a foundation of knowledge I could act on. I knew that this wasn’t REAL progress and I needed to make a lot more happen if I wanted to be able to work on software anytime this decade. I had to get very serious about software.

I did what every young person does when they’re trying to get “serious” about something, I enrolled in college. I figured if I’m going to work on software as important as Bitcoin one day I’ll have to learn computer science from it’s very foundations, what better way than getting a CS degree? This wasn’t a decision I took lightly, I hated school, in fact; I dropped out of highschool as a sophomore and never looked back. It was a terrifying proposition considering returning to the prison I thought I had escaped. It wasnt that I was uninterested in learning, I had just always done it my way, and followed my own curiosities. School isn’t needed for that kind of learning, it’s only a hindrance. However as I continued to learn about Bitcoin I couldn’t help but fall down the rabbit hole and become completely obsessed with the ideas and implications of this new technology, so it seemed college is where I would have to go to master these skills. I spent the following months researching my options for university and preparing to get my GED since I had still never graduated high school. I begrudgingly reengaged with all of the schooling I had hoped to leave behind, relearning highschool math and writing crappy essays in order to acquire my GED. I could write a whole blog about this journey as it was a huge challenge and barrier for me, but still I got the magical piece of paper and now was permitted to attend university.

At the same time I was getting my GED and setting myself up for school, I was also preparing by going deeper into software development and CS fundamentals mostly in the form of podcasts, Youtube, and lectures that I would listen to while working my delivery job. I wasn’t practicing algorithms or anything, I could still hardly write any code, but I was building a mental map of the software world and getting an introduction to how different programming languages are used, how applications are built, and the common terminology used in the space. This helped me plan and route my path through the many topics and technologies I would have to learn in order to eventually build on Bitcoin. This was a huge advantage for me as I was able to enter college knowing what technologies I wanted to learn and my own independent perspective and expectations for myself and what I wanted to gain from my schooling. It was only with this approach that I was able to make the difficult decisions required to eventually accelerate my path into the development world.

My first and last programming class in college was “beginning programming” in C++. This class gave me so much and I was invigorated going through it. Being around other people for the first time who wanted to learn how to code as well as our professor who was a legit senior software engineer meant the world to me and made the material exciting to work through. We learned about fundamental CS concepts and practiced very basic programming using C++. This was definitely more low level compared to my Python courses but because we went through each concept with careful consideration and context I felt I had a better foundational grasp that I could build off of myself. This was important because near the end of the first semester was when I really started looking ahead at my programming/CS courses in the coming semesters with a critical lens. It began to dawn on me that most of these courses were distractions at best when considering the skills and knowledge I wanted to build to work on Bitcoin. For example I had TWO upcoming Visual Basic courses the next two semesters (a rarely used Microsoft focussed language) and that would be almost a year of my time on that! Not to mention the many other electives that were feeling like a complete waste of time and money. I had some tough decisions to make.

It was quickly becoming obvious that outside of my very beneficial beginning programming course this CS program was not going to be worth the time, energy, and money I was burning to get through it. It terrified me to think about stepping out into the unknown again to learn on my own but I knew that if I was purely focused on software, getting a coding job, and Bitcoin that I could make the journey much quicker than four years. I had heard the cliche of the ‘CS grad who cant code’ many times and didnt want that to be me but I needed a better plan than just taking Udemy courses again. Once more I found myself opening my mind, reconsidering my plans, and trying to expose myself to other possible opportunities or routes to my goal. My decision was made once I mustered up the courage to ask my programming professor some very real questions after one of our last classes of the semester. I told him about my goals and my doubts around the curriculum and if he thinks it’s viable to learn application development and eventually Bitcoin development without a CS degree. He gave me a simple answer; “Yeah a lot of the courses in this program aren’t very relevant to what you want to do, you can probably learn the skills you’re trying to gain faster online with a good teacher, but this will make it harder to get a job”. Like a great engineer he summarized the tradeoffs well and it clarified a lot for me hearing it from someone with real skills and experience. I knew with his advice and my prior thoughts it was the right decision to find another path outside of college to continue my journey.

Now I was about to be a highschool dropout and a college dropout, this was not exactly where I thought or hoped I would be after almost a year on this journey. Still I got my mind in order, kept my goals and my progress in the forefront of my mind and began searching for my next opportunity. Like a show of fate, within just a few days I stumbled upon an opportunity that immediately excited me. It was a coding bootcamp called Lambda School (Now [Bloomtech](https://www.bloomtech.com/)) that touted it’s extensive 9 month program and the unique ISA financing option where you dont have to pay any tuition until you get hired as a software developer. This all sounded too good to be true but the more I researched, read reviews, and watched testimonies from former students the more confident I grew that this was the way to go. It’s not like I had many choices though, I was completely broke (except for the Bitcoin I was hodling), I now had some student debt, and it was hard to imagine how I would borrow thousands of dollars to pay for any other bootcamp that would only be three months anyway. The one hesitation I had was the actual curriculum which was full-stack web development, I had never planned on learning anything web specific outside of what would be required to build Bitcoin applications. I knew web development was higher level and not as applicable to Bitcoin as other tracks would be but still what other option did I have? I remembered my professor’s advice and thought carefully about the tradeoffs. “I have no opportunity right now” I thought to myself, “this is some kind of pathway where at the moment I have absolutely none. Maybe I can learn web development, get hired, and then work my way into Bitcoin?”

Within a month I was enrolled in Lambda School and preparing for the start of class by learning and writing my first HTML, starting as a beginner once again. The next few months involved learning HTML / CSS for basic webpage UI development as well as JavaScript fundamentals to start adding logic to these webpages. It was definitely satisfying working on frontend and getting more tangible feedback from my code vs the bare bones C++ and Python I had done prior. Every few days we would learn 3-5 new concepts/techniques and apply them in small projects, this was the perfect format for me to learn as rapidly as possible while still building a solid foundation of knowledge. Additionally I was fully in charge of choosing and learning my own development tools unlike college where they just gave us an IDE, explained nothing about what it was and just gave us step by step instructions on how to navigate through the UI to setup a new file to code in. Not very empowering, where instead now I was learning about coding environments for myself and starting to work with my IDE of choice VScode. Lambda School’s project based curriculum was also a huge help for me since now all of the concepts I was learning were also backed up and paired with projects that could act as examples and references for me forever forward. These web concepts were definitely novel for me and it took some trial and error to work with initially but I was learning and iterating faster than ever which showed the promise of this project based approach versus my previous self directed attempts.

After just a few months in bootcamp I was starting to feel like a developer for the first time. Yeah I had built some basic projects and small websites but really it was all of the knowledge around how developers ACTUALLY work and the tools they use that was informing my new found confidence. For one I saw that most developers have a very modest grasp of the languages/technologies they work with and they simply Google everything they dont know off the top of their head, I assumed up to this point that most coders have to memorize the entire language and know it by heart. In fact Google (or your preferred search/surveillance engine) is probably the most leveraged developer tool of them all and what really separates the seniors vs the juniors is their ability to lookup solutions quickly and efficiently rather than just memorizing syntax. Developers were starting to seem a bit more scrappy from these insights, something I could definitely relate to. Also using Github (something I was previously avoiding) totally leveled up my understanding and connection to the software world. Almost all of the open source code in existence lives on Github (including Bitcoin) and now I could peer into this world and see what big production codebases look like and how the FOSS developers worked together. This was simultaneously the coolest and most intimidating kind of collaboration to witness. I knew I had to get involved as soon as I had the skills.

To my amazement, moving beyond the half point of the curriculum, I was looking like one of the more consistent and promising students in my cohort, not because I was excelling with all of the material though, I was just participating and engaging with it (and the other students) as much as possible. There were many students with past software experience and skills that far exceeded mine and most others in my cohort but these skill differences made little to no impact for these students as they completed the course and went out on their own to find their first developer positions. The real differentiation between students who excelled beyond Lambda School was actually passion, focus, and grit. These serious students came from all manner of backgrounds and skill levels but what was consistent among them was a long term perspective oriented around their goals and a complete willingness to take full responsibility for building their knowledge and experience in order to reach these self defined goals. This potential I and a few other students were showing combined with my bootcamp’s need for more student assistants opened up the opportunity for me and a few others to start working part time as Team Lead’s helping other students through the sections of the curriculum we had already completed. This opportunity meant the world to me and though I was extremely nervous I accepted it without hesitation. I was still working full time as a delivery boy up to this point so now I would be able to work a few shifts on the weekend and instead spend all week collaborating with other students as a TL! This was a much different format which I knew would open up a ton of unique challenges and lessons that would accelerate my journey and give me experience that would be hard to find anywhere else.

Now I found myself in a completely flipped position serving as a team lead in another cohort just starting their curriculum. Instead of acting as a student, a listener, the one asking questions, now I was seen as the authority figure in my team and was expected to answer all of the questions. This was scary initially but as I settled into my new role I found that I was serving my team best by defaulting to the behavior I had as a student, treating everyone as peers. I was still on the hook as far as making sure everyone knew how to do their assignments and helping them get unblocked if they were stuck but we all progressed the most by teaching each other, working together, and acting as equals. It was amazing and informative working with these new developers, I related to them so much since I was in their shoes just 6 months back and I got to see them go on the same emotional rollercoaster and make many of the same mistakes I did. This helped me really start seeing common patterns in how new devs both excel and fall behind. One of the most clear patterns to follow was the willingness for a student to own the knowledge/skills they were obtaining versus exclusively relying on the resources and examples provided. I would constantly encounter these students that just wanted to complete the homework and “check boxes”. They didnt care much that they weren’t fully grasping the content of our projects, how they worked, or how to replicate them. This harkens back to highschool and college for me where it seems like this box checking is all you need to do to succeed. On the other hand with programming, from what I’ve seen, those that have the most trouble are often the ones that have a decent amount of “experience” but they never owned it or went all in letting their learnings culminate into some kind of project. They just did the homework, moved on, and stagnated.

All in all I spent a total of ten months as a Team Lead at Lambda School. In this time I worked with three different cohorts and was a TL on five different teams of students. I got to simultaneously pursue my development journey while walking beside and mentoring many other students doing the same. This left me with a strong sense of the psyche, the struggles, and the general path for the noob developer trying to make it. This experience meant so much to me and it helped reveal my passion for working with and helping other developers as well as greatly informing my personal trajectory and path forward post bootcamp. One of the main inspirations behind starting this blog and calling myself “bitcoinplebdev” was the fulfillment I got working with these students and the sense of mission and urgency to contribute to Bitcoin but also help bolster and grow the community of Bitcoin contributors.

Nearing the conclusion of my bootcamp experience I began to feel a strong pull to prove my skills/experience by building my first full fledged app. I wanted to build something that I believed in and somehow spoke to my passion for Bitcoin and FOSS, not just another to-do app or throw away project. I thought on this for sometime, I had dozens of project ideas in fact, I couldnt stop thinking of things I wanted to build or just wanted to exist, but I had to find where the idea, my skills, and my interests intersected. After carefully weighing the options I decided on building a simple tool that would allow individuals to reclaim, search, and explore all of their Facebook data. This was perfect for me as I HATED Facebook and was growing more concerned about the monopoly on personal data that they and many other big tech companies had. I wanted the average user to be able to securely pull the entirety of their FB data history and be able to explore it in a simple UI. My hope was that this would help users experience the asymmetry of info that these companies had on them and also take a first small step to reclaiming it. I also decided upfront that this app would be open source, it would store absolutely no user data whatsoever, and put the responsibility on the user to hold onto their data once it was handed off to them through the app. This wasn’t the most simple idea but I was able to chunk into two distinct problems to solve in order to reach my MVP (minimum viable product), which was collecting the data on behalf of the user, and allowing the data to be parsed and explored in a simple UI.

Though I felt my planning and scoping process was clean, things quickly became messy as I started building out my first prototype. I had never worked with such complicated and nested data before, I found myself for the first few weeks just building data parsers to try and organize and capture all of this information so I could display it in the frontend. One day after a long session with this prototype I hit a wall and felt completely overwhelmed with all of the spaghetti code I had produced. I had to set it aside, and take a few days off. I came back around again with some new ideas for an approach and promptly got started. After a few weeks in with this second attempt I once again got blocked, felt completely stuck, and had to step away. Over the next 4-6 months I went through this miserable cycle again and again, getting a little bit farther each time. The more I got stuck, discouraged, and burned out the more the idea for this app entranced me and pulled me in. I had grown to love this idea and attach my identity to it, I wanted to be the person that made this capability available for others, I wanted to be the person that finished this despite my struggles, and I wanted so badly for my first project to express my distaste for big tech surveillance and my desire to help create FOSS tools that strengthen individuals. I kept on pushing.

By my fifth or sixth attempt I discovered something that would allow me to alter my approach and greatly reduce the amount of code and UI I needed to produce. Up until this point I had been pulling the Facebook data as raw JSON and parsing it in an overcomplicated manner but suddenly I noticed something that had been right in front of my face since I started that I had never thought about.. I realized I could pull all of the same data from Facebook as HTML, and instead of parsing it I could render it with some modifications within the actual app window. This insight immediately transformed how I had been thinking about the architecture, and simplified a lot of the build that had been blocking me. This lit a new fire in me and got me excitedly back into the drivers seat to try again. Despite starting from scratch once again I was soon making rapid progress integrating all of the experience from my previous attempts and working up to a point in the build I had never gotten to. With my recent progress I was now rendering and navigating almost all of the data in my app now and I was able to mostly automate the data pull from Facebook for the user, it was an amazing feeling, I was so close to the end.

Even with this progress I was still having trouble deserializing the images and videos in the data to get them to render properly, this was a whole other problem to solve that could keep me from reaching my MVP. Still I patiently dug into this problem and started formulating some solutions. After just a week I got a working example rendering images and videos but it greatly changed how I would need to architect the rendering components in the app so I knew this would require another build. One final time, on my eighth attempt I carefully planned out all of the components I knew I would be integrating, came up with the most simple possible structure for the build, and started typing away. After two more weeks of building I finally completed everything and was able to go through the entire app flow again and again amazed to witness it working without errors. I was completely enthralled, relieved, and on the verge of tears, I finally did it! A few weeks later on December 31st 2019 I released [fbexplorer.app](http://fbexplorer.app/) to a handful of my friends and other users willing to try it out. fbexplorer is still up and working to this day!

Building fbexplorer was one of the most important and clarifying chapters on my development path. People often suggest building a side project before going on the job search, but I truly felt I needed to prove my skills to myself and the world by authoring and building out my own project before pushing on into the next phase of my development trek and starting the hunt for my first coding job. I highly suggest using a side project like this as a final test or challenge to take on in the final chapter of your journey learning the basics. This will spark a ton of confidence in yourself and help you stand out amongst other candidates as you’re trying to get that first programming gig.

With fbexplorer completed, I now felt I could focus fully on the job search. I had applied to a few moonshot opportunities up until this point but hadnt been able to give it my full attention. I was still working as a delivery boy up until this point and now was back to full time hours again as my contract for the team lead position at my bootcamp expired. I was living in two worlds once again, trying my best to make my developer dreams come to life, and delivering sandwiches to all manner of miserable individuals at the same time. I knew I needed to split my free time into three equal parts if I wanted to get a job anytime soon. First was working on my “career artifacts” (as my bootcamp called it) which meant getting my portfolio up to snuff and iterating/improving on my resume and cover letter template, not very fun. Second was practicing basic coding and algorithm problems to prepare for potential future technical interviews. Third was actually searching for and applying to relevant developer job postings. Bouncing between these three different areas of focus basically summarizes my job search experience but really there is a whole game that I had to learn in order to make it eventually.

Finding a job in software (especially your first one) requires you to basically treat yourself as brand and approach each opportunity from the employers perspective. Who are they really looking for, what is there company culture like, what are the ACTUAL skillsets they need, what would an amazing candidate look like to them. Answering questions like these will not only prepare you for each particular opportunity but also help you iterate on your career artifacts and skills to craft yourself into the ‘perfect candidate’. This whole job search game did not come natural to me by any means, but since I stayed consistent and kept iterating it slowly caught on. It’s an absolute grind and it’s where a lot of junior developers fall off the wagon. My one advantage over others is that I expected this and prepared for a marathon over a sprint. Expectations can be a killer in this process.

All in all it still took me about 7 months and just under 200 applications (with cover letters) before I got hired. When I finally got the offer to join a small startup as an implementation engineer I was in total disbelief, I had seen so many others make it and it had been so long I just couldn’t comprehend that it was finally my time. Accepting this offer I felt a huge sense of victory and relief that washed over me for weeks, I had effectively jumped up an economic class in one fell swoop. A few weeks later I went in to work my last shift ever as a delivery boy on a Sunday and started as an implementation engineer at my company the very next day. As much of a victory getting hired was I knew that my journey was just beginning, I held the dream of becoming a Bitcoin dev deep in my heart and never let go, I promised myself that I absolutely wouldnt become comfortable in my position, I would keep on pushing, and think of this job exclusively as a stepping stone into bitcoin, and a means to accelerate my learning.

I have kept my promises to myself thus far, since starting my new position I’ve been consistently working on a few Bitcoin related side projects (using the skills I have), trying to make a few contributions to FOSS projects, and trying a hundred different ways to approach the skills I need to learn in order to work with Bitcoin at a more fundamental level. I’ve tried to learn these skills so many times throughout my development journey but always fell flat and was left feeling that I dont have the necessary experience or prerequisites to approach Bitcoin development. Nonetheless, the sum total of all of these failed attempts has left me with a ton of context and knowledge that I picked up while trying to learn, it’s helped me slowly build up to the point where I feel I’m truly ready to dive in headfirst.

Bitcoin development is totally humbling for anyone especially a plebdev like me, and trying to grind these skills alongside a demanding startup job is not ideal, but the more I push myself to take the next step the more opportunities for learning and growth seem to open up. Most recently I stumbled upon a newer Bitcoin transactions/protocol course created by @niftynei and @stakamoto21 called [Base58](https://www.base58.info/). This seemed like the perfect opportunity for me and a very approachable path for starting to work with Bitcoin transactions at the protocol level. I’m going through Base58 now, learning a ton, and absolutely loving it, I cant wait to write about it more and share some of what I’ve learned.

My story is far from over but I knew it was the right time for me to share how I got here and start documenting my journey into Bitcoin development. I didnt take the most efficient path learning to code or approaching Bitcoin development but I took the one thats right for me, and now I’m closer than ever to gaining the skills I’ve been seeking and starting to meet and collaborate with other devs in the space. I’m continually humbled and reminded that I’m not special on this journey which is why I’m confident that many more plebs can make the journey like me even though they may not be the most inclined or “obvious” individuals to do it. I hope to connect with, encourage, and help any plebdevs on their journey or those who are looking to start. I want to live in and help manifest the future where a million new plebs are rising up as developers and building on Bitcoin and FOSS. Bitcoin/FOSS obviously need 10x engineers but we also need thousands of 1x engineers to step up and build, support, and maintain the infrastructure that will enable hyperbitcoinization and help billions of people interact with Bitcoin in an open, secure, and KYC free manner.
